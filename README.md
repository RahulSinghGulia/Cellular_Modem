📶 Cellular Modem – 5G Communication System Simulator
This repository presents a comprehensive simulation framework for a 5G cellular modem, built entirely in Python. It includes modular implementations of key physical and network layer functionalities, enabling you to simulate, analyze, and evaluate various aspects of 5G wireless communication systems.

Whether you're studying cellular principles, experimenting with different modulation schemes, or evaluating channel coding performance, this simulator provides a flexible and insightful platform.

✨ Features
Our 5G Modem Simulator is designed for modularity and extensibility, offering:

Configurable Parameters: Easily adjust parameters like modulation type (BPSK, QPSK, QAM up to 256-QAM), SNR, coding schemes, and more via config.py.
Modular Architecture: Each component of the communication chain is implemented as a separate module, allowing for easy experimentation and replacement.
Channel Modeling: Simulate realistic wireless environments with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and various fading models (Rayleigh, Rician).
Error Correction: Implement and test Forward Error Correction (FEC) with popular channel coding schemes like LDPC and Polar codes.
Performance Metrics: Tools for calculating and visualizing key performance indicators such as Bit Error Rate (BER), Symbol Error Rate (SER), and Power Spectral Noise Ratio (PSNR).
Visualization Tools: Generate eye diagrams, BER curves, and constellation plots to intuitively understand system behavior.
