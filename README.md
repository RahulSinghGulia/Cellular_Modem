    - Simulate signal transmission and reception.

* OFDM Transmission and Reception
    - Implement Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
    - Add cyclic prefix and perform IFFT/FFT.

* Channel Modeling
    - Simulate different channel effects (AWGN, Rayleigh, Rician fading).
    - Implement MIMO channel.

* Error Correction (Channel Coding)
    - Implement LDPC or Polar coding.
    - Simulate decoding with noise.

* Physical Layer Simulation
    - Integrate modulation, OFDM, and channel models.
    - Simulate BER vs SNR.

* Beamforming and MIMO
    - Implement Massive MIMO beamforming.
    - Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for precoding.

* Resource Allocation & Scheduling
    - Implement dynamic scheduling of resources.
    - Optimize subcarrier allocation for users.

* Network Layer Simulation
    - Implement 5G NR frame structure.
    - Simulate handover scenarios.
